Hello, user!
This is an addon folder created mainly for github-users.

.gitignore file tells github to ignore this folder which allows you to pull
changes from original main branch without loosing your changes in EM mod.

It is advised to use this folder to extend/change/modify EM mod!
To avoid duplicating file names, add in front of file names addon_
For example: addon_items.xml or addon_afflictions.xml

Remember to override existing stuff, if you want to modify.
You are free to add your stuff in this folder as well.
